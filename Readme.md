# Autonomous Car Simulation

This project is a simulation program for autonomous driving cars. The simulation operates within a rectangular field where multiple cars can be added, each with a unique name, starting position, and direction they are facing. The cars can execute a series of commands to navigate within the field. This project uses object-oriented principles, dependency injection, and is implemented in C#.

## Features

- Create a rectangular field for the simulation.
- Add multiple cars to the field with specified initial positions and directions.
- Execute commands (`L`, `R`, `F`) for each car to move within the field.
- Handle boundary conditions to ensure cars do not move outside the field.
- Detect and report collisions between cars.

## Directions

- `N`: North
- `E`: East
- `S`: South
- `W`: West

## Commands

- `L`: Rotate the car 90 degrees to the left.
- `R`: Rotate the car 90 degrees to the right.
- `F`: Move the car forward by 1 grid point in the direction it is currently facing.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 SDK or higher

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/autonomous-car-simulation.git
   cd autonomous-car-simulation
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:
```sh
dotnet test
```

## Project Structure

- `Program.cs`: The main entry point of the application.
- `Field.cs`: Contains the implementation of the field and simulation logic.
- `Car.cs`: Contains the implementation of the car and its movements.
- `CardinalDirection.cs`: Enum defining the directions (N, E, S, W).
- `ICar.cs` and `IField.cs`: Interfaces for `Car` and `Field` classes.
- `FieldTests.cs` and `CarTests.cs`: Unit tests for the `Field` and `Car` classes.

## Example Usage

After launching the program, you will be prompted to enter the dimensions of the field, add cars, and issue commands. Here is a sample interaction:

```sh
Welcome to Auto Driving Car Simulation!
Please enter the width and height of the simulation field in x y format:
10 10
You have created a field of 10 x 10.
Please choose from the following options:
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
[3] Exit
1
Please enter the name of the car:
A
Please enter the initial position of the car in x y direction format (e.g., 1 2 N):
1 2 N
Please enter the commands for the car:
FFRFFFRRLF
[1] Add a car to field
[2] Run simulation
[3] Exit
2
Your current list of cars are:
- A, (1,2) N, FFRFFFRRLF
After simulation, the result is:
- A, (4,3) S
Please choose from the following options:
[1] Start over
[2] Exit
```
